# Advent of Code 2021

To run a solution do something like:

```sh
$ make run day=01
runghc --ghc-arg=-Wall Day01.hs < inputs/day01.txt
Part 1: 1529
Part 2: 1567
```

Compile instead for speed gains:

```sh
make compile day=05
```

Watch files, recompile, & run:

```sh
make watch day=01
```

Make solution & input files for new day:

```sh
make new-day day=09
```
